# Challenge Restaurant Dashboard
The goal of this project is to create a cutting-edge dashboard that empowers travel agents to provide personalized recommendations to travelers on the finest dining destinations throughout Europe. This will elevate the travel experience and help ensure that each trip is filled with unforgettable culinary experiences.

## Description
The project is organized into two key stages, reflected in the folder structure of the repository.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment.ipynb file contains the code used to analyze the sentiment of Tripadvisor reviews for each restaurant. The code also processes the list of cuisines mentioned in the data and sets up a many-to-many relationship with the restaurants.

Interactive Dashboard: The Dashboard.pbix file is the centerpiece of this project, providing travel agents with a range of tools to make informed recommendations. The dashboard gives the user the ability to search for restaurants based on city, cuisine type, ratings, price range, and review sentiment, helping ensure that every trip is filled with dining experiences that meet each traveler's unique needs.

## Getting Started
