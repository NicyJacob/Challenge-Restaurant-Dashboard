# Challenge Restaurant Dashboard
The objective of the project is to build a dashboard to help travel agents make recommendation to travellers on the best food destination for their trips across Europe.

## Description
The project is divided into 2 steps represented in the folder structure of this repository.
1. Sentiment.ipynb: This code was used to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews recieved on Tripadvisor for each restaurant. This code also splits the list of cuisines mentioned in the dataset into different rows and establishes a many-to-many relationship with the restaurants.
2. Dashboard.pbix : The dashboard gives the travel agent options to select restaurants based on city, cuisine type, ratings, price category and review sentiments.


## Getting Started
